I wrote this script to automize to restart my local web logic server.
If you are here you may already needed it.Sometimes the environment requires deploy frequently and it due to heuristic mixed exception.
So if u dont want to restart your own and avoid wasting your time by doing yourself 
All you need to configure the properties file and execute batchfile.
