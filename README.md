# weblogic-datasource-restarter
What is it?

I wrote this script to automize to restart my local web logic server datasources.
If you are here you may already needed it. Sometimes the environment requires deploy frequently and cause to heuristic mixed exception.
So if you dont want to restart your own from console and avoid wasting your time
all you need to configure the properties file once and execute batch file when you need.
