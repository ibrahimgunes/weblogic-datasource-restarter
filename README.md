# weblogic-datasource-restarter
What is it? 
I have written this script to automate the restart of my local WebLogic server data sources. If you are here, you may already need it. Sometimes, the environment requires frequent deployments, which can result in a mixed exception. If you want to avoid restarting manually from the console and save time, all you need to do is configure the properties file once and execute the batch file whenever you need it.
