# weblogic-datasource-restarter
What is it?
I wrote this script to automize to restart of my local web logic server data sources. If you are here you may already need it. Sometimes the environment requires to deploy frequently and causes a heuristic mixed exception. If you don't want to restart your own from the console and avoid wasting time, all you need to configure the properties file once and execute the batch file when you need it.
